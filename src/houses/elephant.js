                The linear expanse of Domino Park runs 
                along the East River, boasting uninterrupted vistas of Manhattanâ€™s skyscrapers. We 
                lit the 
                park to emphasize this interplay of horizontal and vertical sightlines. We placed 
                4000k sources within the two turquoise cranes which overlook the park. The emanating 
                light amplifies the rhythm of shadow and material, creating an unexpected complement to the 
                iconic skyline across the water. Atop the elevated Artifact Walk, which offers perhaps the 
                best vantage of the river, we used continuous 3000k rail lighting, and highlighting the upper 
                portions of the columns with 3500k LED accent lights. When visitors walk along, the experience is 
                part-industrial, part-theatrical, and completely New York.
